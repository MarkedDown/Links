# Link Section
 
</div>

<br>

If you want to have a central place in your document to place <br>
your links, you will want to create a dedicated section for it.

You could place it anywhere in your project, though obviously <br>
at the top / bottom would seem the most sensible for this.

In this case I would strongly ***`encourage to place it At The Bottom`*** <br>
as otherwise you will have to traverse it every time you want ot edit the file.
