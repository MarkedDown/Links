# Link Section
 
<br>

If you want to centralize your links, you <br>
will want to create a dedicated section.

You could place this section anywhere, <br>
however the most sensible positions are<br>
of course the top and bottom of the file.

<br>
<br>

## Bottom

Placing it in the bottom is helpful, as you <br>
won't have to traverse the links every time <br>
you want to edit the file's content.

The inverse problem of having to scroll a long <br>
way down to get to the section can be mitigated <br>
by refactoring markdown files to be nice & short.

*Also handwritten links usually don't change as* <br>
*often as the actual content of a markdown file.*

<br>
