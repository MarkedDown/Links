<br>

I would almost always ***`recommend to use Referenced Links`*** , <br>
as they can move the clutter - that is their **URL** - into a dedicated<br>
section and thus make your documentation more readable.

<br>

##### Let Me Give You An Example

This not very readable example paragraph, whos links don't <br>
even contain any parameters, can be significantly tidied up

<br>

```markdown
XYZ comes with a comprehensize **[API](https://organization.github.io/project/docs)** as well as <br>
the ability to integrate with **[Moodle](https://moodle.org/)** / [Canvas](https://its.sdsu.edu/tools/canvas).
```

<br>

into 2 readable section, such as

<br>

```markdown
Comes with a comprehensive **[API]** as well as <br>
the ability to integrate with **[Moodle]** / **[Canvas]**.
```

<div align = 'center'>

**+**

</div>

```markdown
[Moodle]: https://moodle.org/
[Canvas]: https://its.sdsu.edu/tools/canvas
[API]: https://organization.github.io/project/docs
```

<br>

##### Where To Put The Links

You may want to simply group your links into local collections <br>
on a `Per-Paragraph` basis or instead have a `Link Section` .
