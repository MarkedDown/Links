# Links

**Markdown** links can be categorized into `Direct` & `Referenced` links.

<br>

#### Direct

Links of this type place the `URL` close to their declaration.

<br>

#### Referenced

With this type, the links' value can be decoupled from it's <br>
declaration which allows it to be placed wherever desired.

## Advice

I would almost always ***`recommend to use Referenced Links`*** , <br>
as they can move the clutter - that is their **URL** - into a dedicated<br>
section and thus make your documentation more readable.
